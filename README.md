# Baby-Names
This project will let you know more about your name in different months, years or even decades other than when you were born.
You will be able to know what will be your name if you were born in another different year or month.
You will know how many babies that have the same name as yours who were born in the same birth date as yours. 
You will know how popular was your name when you were born,and so many other informations about your name. 
Did you have a basic name? or did everyone wondered where did your parents get this name from? aren't you curious?
For this project, i have data on baby names from the United States and will answer questions about this data. The data files give information on the first names of people born in a particular year.i have data from 1880 through 2014 on both boys and girls names. 
This project works with CSV files and all the applications on them.
I wrote a method for every function for this project and below are these method and their description.
#totalBirth: this method counts and then prints the number of boys names, the number of girls names and the total names in the file. 
#getRank: this method returns the rank of the name of given gender in a file.
#getName: this method rturns a name at a given rank.
#whatIsNameInYear: this method determines what will be your name if you were born in a different year. 
#yearOfHighestRank:this method determines the year of the highest rank for a given name in different files.
#getAverageRank:this method selects a range of files to process and returns a double representing the average rank of the name and gender over the selected files. 
#getTotalBirthsRankedHigher:This method returns an integer, the total number of births of those names with the same gender and same year who are ranked higher than name.
